## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Configuration

Start by setting up your mfer configuration:

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

mfer uses a YAML configuration file located at `~/.mfer/config.yaml`. Here's an example structure:

```yaml
base_github_url: "https://github.com/your-username"
mfe_directory: "/path/to/your/micro-frontends"
groups:
  all:
    - my-main-app
    - my-admin-panel
    - my-shared-components
  main:
    - my-main-app
    - my-shared-components
  admin:
    - my-admin-panel
    - my-shared-components
```

### Configuration Options

- **`base_github_url`**: Your GitHub base URL for repository operations
- **`mfe_directory`**: Path to the directory containing all your micro frontend projects
- **`groups`**: Named collections of micro frontend projects
  - **`all`**: Default group containing all projects (required)
  - **Custom groups**: Any additional groups you want to create

### Editing Configuration

You can edit your configuration in several ways:

1. **Interactive editor** (recommended):

   ```bash
   mfer config edit
   ```

2. **Direct file editing**:

   ```bash
   # On macOS/Linux
   nano ~/.mfer/config.yaml

   # On Windows
   notepad %USERPROFILE%\.mfer\config.yaml
   ```

## üéØ Use Cases

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Start your day
mfer pull          # Get latest changes
mfer run main      # Start main application

# Later, switch to admin panel work
mfer run admin     # Start admin panel
```

### Project Organization

Organize your micro frontends into logical groups:

```yaml
groups:
  all:
    - main-app
    - admin-panel
    - user-dashboard
    - shared-components
    - design-system
  core:
    - main-app
    - shared-components
    - design-system
  admin:
    - admin-panel
    - user-dashboard
    - shared-components
  ui:
    - shared-components
    - design-system
```

### Team Collaboration

- Share configuration files with your team
- Standardize development environment setup
- Ensure everyone runs the same services

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Custom Start Commands

By default, mfer runs `npm start` in each project directory.
You can currently only customize this by modifying the run command in the source code.

Adding configurable custom start commands is something I plan on adding in the near future.
I also welcome anyone to open a PR for that!

### Environment Variables

mfer respects your existing environment setup and will use the same Node.js and npm versions you have configured.

### Process Management

- All processes are managed concurrently with organized output
- Use Ctrl+C to gracefully shut down all running services
- Failed processes are reported with detailed error information

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No configuration file detected"**

```bash
# Run the initialization wizard
mfer init
```

**"Group not found"**

```bash
# Check available groups
mfer config list

# Edit configuration to add missing group
mfer config edit
```

**"Directory does not exist"**

- Ensure the `mfe_directory` path in your configuration is correct
- Use absolute paths for better reliability
- Check that the directory exists and is accessible

**"Not a git repository"**

- Ensure all projects in your configuration are valid git repositories
- Run `mfer clone` to clone missing repositories

### Development Mode

For local development of mfer itself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/srimel/mfer.git
cd mfer
npm install
npm run build
npm install -g .
```

Refer to [local development](./docs/local-development.md) docs for more information.
